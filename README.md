This repository contains all scripts used in the paper "Exploiting pair correlation function to describe biological tissue structure". Here we functions located in the "List_function_pcf_analysis.R" file script to perform PCF-SiM analysis but we recommend to use the R [PCFSiM package](https://github.com/BOSTLAB/PCFSiM).
Original and processed datasets can be found on a [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/17867607).
